proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . </s> nicole kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while . </s> nicole kidman makes it a party worth attending . </s> no , i love it ... hell , i dunno . </s> no , it not as single-minded as john carpenter original , but it sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels . </s> no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get

sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it a love story as sanguine as its title . </s> is one of this year very best pictures . </s> it refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original . </s> likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes . </s> made eddie murphy a movie star and the man has aged a day . </s> more precious than perspicacious </s> ou got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane . </s> smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off - broadway play . </s> that it probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture </s> that works . </s> the film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public </s> there is truth here </s> unpretentious , charming , quirky , original </s> waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it . </s> waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . </s> wo be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time . </s> works , it thanks to huston revelatory performance . </s> would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed the french lieutenant woman . </s>
